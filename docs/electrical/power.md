# Power Management 

## Overview
All the HomeR's electrical components are powered by 2x 18650 Lithium-ion batteries (7.4V nominal).
HomeR takes the 7.4V DC to drive the motors.
A voltage regulator is responsible to convert the coarse battery power (could be 6V to 8.4V) to stabilized 5V then serve it to the computing devices (Pico and Pi).
