# Setup ROS 2 Environment

## 0. Recommended Apparatus
- CPU: X86_64, ARM64
- Operating System: Ubuntu 24.04.

!!! note "Operating System"
    According to the [REP-2000](https://reps.openrobotics.org/rep-2000/#jazzy-jalisco-may-2024---may-2029) list, Ubuntu 24.04 and Windows 10 are both tier 1 supported OS by ROS 2 Jazzy, but installing Windows on Raspberry Pi is not easy for beginners. 
    So, we will install both Ubuntu 24.04 on Raspberry Pi and a desktop/laptop computer. 
    Also, we are not going to expand the scope to other OS, despite the fact that you can possibly install ROS 2 on any OS.

## 1. Installation
We recommend you following the official [guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html) to install ROS 2 with Ubuntu `deb` packages.

!!! danger "Version Binding"
    If this is your first time, please strictly bind the ROS 2 version: **Jazzy** with Ubuntu version: **24.04**.
