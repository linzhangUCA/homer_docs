# Meet HomeR

**Home(plate)R(obot)** is an open-source mobile robot platform.
HomeR is designed for educational purposes with emphases on autonomous **SLAM** and **navigation**.
It features a differential drive mobile base regulated by a **Raspberry Pi Pico** microcontroller.
The Robot Operating System (ROS), as a butler serves a **Raspberry Pi** SBC making high-level decisions.
